SYCL is an evolving and new standard.  tensorflow and Eigen are not yet parseable as SYCL

- why not write the device-side code as SPIR-V?

SPIR-V is an evolving and new standard, and not widely supported yet by OpenCL-enabled devices

- is this really a viable approach for Tensorflow?

I dont know :-P
