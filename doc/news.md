  - [test/eigen/test_cuda_elementwise_small.cu](https://github.com/hughperkins/cuda-on-cl/blob/a8f6aa55eb678e534cc7d17a3db26c6b8762d683/test/eigen/test_cuda_elementwise_small.cu) builds and runs ok now, on OpenCL :-)
- Oct 8:
  - [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_gpu_add.cu.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_gpu_add.cu.cc) compiles completely into compileable OpenCL now [https://github.com/hughperkins/cuda-on-cl/blob/d491aca1b5123781ac59486d38b09fbecd049f45/tensorflow/generated/cwise_op_gpu_add-deviceside.cl](https://github.com/hughperkins/cuda-on-cl/blob/d491aca1b5123781ac59486d38b09fbecd049f45/tensorflow/generated/cwise_op_gpu_add-deviceside.cl)
  - implemented `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMemcpy`, `cudaFree` (using opencl)
  - hostside object now contains generated OpenCL sourcecode
- Oct 5
  - fix float constants to correctly have `.0f` at the end
  - added `extractvalue`
  - conversion of [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_gpu_add.cu.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_op_gpu_add.cu.cc) to OpenCL runs to completion now, though the OpenCL generated is not yet compileable
- Oct 4:
  - added `llvm.memcpy`
  - added `insertvalue`
  - added `dumpinttoptr`, `trunc`, `srem` (beta)
- Oct 3
  - added `float4` (beta)
  - added `local` memory (beta)
- Oct 2:
  - added structs
- Oct 1:
  - first working end-to-end kernel launch, using both host-side and device-side code :-)
- Sept 30:
  - added initial unit tests, that use pyopencl to compile the generated OpenCL code, and run tests against it
- Sept 27:
  - first created
